        Your first month is processed within one business day. Subscriptions shipping to the United States usually take 7-10 business days to arrive from the ship date. International orders may take up to 3 weeks to arrive. For each month after, you
        can expect your baller box to arrive at roughly the same time every month. International delivery times vary, but usually take 3-4 weeks for your first pair top arrive due to many variables out of our control. Additionally, to get the
        international shipping cost down so low we are unable to provide tracking information. But if you are having trouble with your shipment, donâ€™t hesitate to get in touch at info@BallerBox.com
        <strong>PLEASE NOTE: Our shipping deadline is the 20th of each month. If your order is processed after that, your subscription will roll over and begin the following month.</strong>
        As soon as your order ships, you will be provided with a tracking number via email. </p>
